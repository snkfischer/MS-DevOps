# Azure Monitor
To observe and respond to your complete Azure landscape, Azure Monitor provides rich metrics and logs regardless of the type of resources you choose to run your application. 

Monitoring in Azure typically starts with diagnostic metrics and metric solutions like **Network Watcher**, and logs from **Log Analytics** for various resource types. This can be further enhanced with **Application Insights** for application and dependency layer performance monitoring (which will be covered in the next module). Once these *signals* are established they gain potency from **smart alerts** and **automated actions**. 

Monitoring is not just designed for a constant barrage of alerts though. These metrics can also inform the DevOps lifecycle for your application and where to take it next.

We could spend *a lot* of time with the nuances of monitoring, more time than we have for this workshop. Instead we are going to focus on performing a few key exercises to get you thinking about the vast possibilities in Azure Monitor. Let's get started.
