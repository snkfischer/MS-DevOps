# Collaborating with Microsoft Teams

A great resource for learning more about Azure DevOps is [Azure DevOps Labs](https://azuredevopslabs.com).  Azure DevOps Labs is a collection of hands-on-labs produced by Microsoft focused solely on the use of Azure DevOps.  This is a great starting point if you are looking to understand how Azure DevOps can integrate with your service or toolchain of choice.

For the purposes of our workshop today, we will use the "Microsoft Teams with Azure DevOps Services (Collaborate, Communicate and Celebrate)".

The hands-on-lab will walk you through creating a new Team and then integrating your new team with your Azure DevOps organization.

In the section titled "Getting started with Microsoft Teams", you will be prompted to create a team.  Please name your team after the Azure DevOps project that you have been assigned (Project1, Project2, Project3...)  This will ensure that you each have your own Team that you can use to explore.
