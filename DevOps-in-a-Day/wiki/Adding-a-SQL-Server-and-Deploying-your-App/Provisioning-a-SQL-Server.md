# Provisioning a SQL Server

Every great app needs a database, am i right? Maybe not, but we'll be provisioning an Azure SQL database regardless ;-)

> **What is Azure SQL Database?**
>
> Azure SQL Database is a general-purpose relational database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, and secure cloud database that you can use to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice, without needing to manage infrastructure.

We'll be using Azure SQL Databases because they're easy to create, inexpensive, and the foundation of many apps in Azure. 

Let's get to it.
