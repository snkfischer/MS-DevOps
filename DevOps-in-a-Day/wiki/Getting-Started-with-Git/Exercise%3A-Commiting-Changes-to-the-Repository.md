# Exercise: Commiting Changes to the Repository

Now that we have our own personal copy of our Git repository, what do we do with it?

Inside of Visual Studio Code, open the README.md file.  Add a line so that the contents of the file now looks like:

```
# DevOps in a Day

Hello, world!
```

After saving the file, notice in the file explorer that the README.md file is now highlighted and tagged with an "M" to indicate that it has been modified.

Notice the Activity Bar on the left that the Source Control icon now has a badge indicate the number of pending changes in the repository.

Click on the Source Control icon to switch the Side Bar to show the Source Control pane.

In the Message text box, type "added Hello World to README.md".  Git requires a commit message for each commit made.  This may differ from other source control providers which you have used in the past.

Hover your mouse over the *Changes* title bar, and click the '+' icon.  This will stage all of the pending changes to be committed.

With a commit message in place, and our changes staged, we are now ready to make our commit.  Hover your mouse over the *Source Control: Git* title bar, and click the check mark icon.
