# Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps provides a suite of tools for operations, development, and other teams to plan work, collaborate, and build and deploy their applications.  Azure DevOps is offered in two models:

- Azure DevOps Services
- Azure DevOps Server

Azure DevOps Services is a cloud-hosted software-as-a-service, managed entirely by Microsoft.  Shortly after signing up for the service a team can immediately get to work.

The Azure DevOps product team releases updates to the platform in three week intervals.  Features are released in waves through a private preview, public preview, and then are generally available.  While features are in preview, they can be enabled on a per-user and/or per-organization basis using feature flags.

Azure DevOps Server, previously called Team Foundation Server (TFS), is installed on-premise.  You manage the hardware, storage, networking, etc. and are responsbile for installations and upgrades as new versions are released.

The Azure DevOps product team strives to release quarterly updates to Azure DevOps Server.  As features are vetted in Azure DevOps, they are released to Azure DevOps Server.

Whether using Azure DevOps or Azure DevOps Server, your team will have access to the same suite of tools:

- Azure Repos - utilize Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) to store source code and revisions
- Azure Pipelines - offers build and release services to provide continuous integration and continuous deployment
- Azure Boards - collaborate with team members to plan and work using Agile planning tools
- Azure Test Plans - tools for defining and running manual and exploratory test plans
- Azure Artifacts - share packages (software libraries) among team members to enable re-use within your organization

Thanks enough of that, let's login and see Azure DevOps!
