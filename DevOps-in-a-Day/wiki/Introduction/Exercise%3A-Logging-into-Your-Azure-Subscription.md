## Logging into your Azure Subscription

In today's lab, we're providing an Azure subscription. Let's login and ensure you can access it.

We *highly* recommend using the subscription we've provided. Why? We find Azure subscriptions associated with your corporate credentials (or an existing subscription from work) are often locked down, preventing you from logging in, creating virtual machines, managing security access,updating networking configuration, etc.   

# Exercise: Logging into your Azure Subscription

Open an "Incognito" or "Private" web browser session - this helps to ensure you're not using personal or corporate accounts.

Browse to the following page https://portal.azure.com. You will be prompted to login.

Enter the credentials for the Microsoft account we've provided to you. You will be redirected to the Sign up page.
