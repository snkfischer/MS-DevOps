# Exercise: Connecting to Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams allows teams of any size to chat, host online meetings, and share files among themselves.  In addition, Teams supports an open ecosytem of apps to help deepen those collaborative experiences.  As a part of our workshop today, we will see how Azure DevOps integrates with Microsoft Teams to help help boost our team's productivity.

We'll be using the workshop VM which you previously provisioned.  While connected to your workshop VM, open an web browser.

Navigate to https://teams.microsoft.com.  When prompted to sign in to your account, enter your workshop e-mail address (likely similar to user1@something.onmicrosoft.com).  Click **Next**.

When prompted, enter the associated password and click **Sign in**.

When asked to *Stay signed in*, click **Yes**.

For the purpose of today's workshop, we'll simply use the Teams web app, so if you are prompted to download the Teams desktop app, simply click **Use the web app instead**.

Once Teams is loaded, feel free to click **Turn on** to turn on desktop notifications.

You will see that a default Team (Contoso) has been created and all of our workshop accounts have been added.
