# Exercise: Connecting to Azure DevOps

For the purpose of our workshop today, we have provisioned a number of Azure DevOps organizations, and assigned users to each organization.  Please see the connection details that your proctor has shared with you.

We'll be using the workshop VM which you previously provisioned.  While connected to your workshop VM, open an web browser.

Navigate to the Azure DevOps organization specified on your Workshop Information Sheet.  Azure DevOps uses a URL scheme similar to https://dev.azure.com/organization_name.

When prompted to sign in to your account, enter your workshop e-mail address (likely similar to user1@something.onmicrosoft.com).  Click **Next**.

When prompted, enter the associated password and click **Sign in**.

When asked to *Stay signed in*, click **Yes**.

Once you are logged in, you should see a project dedicated for your use for the duration of the workshop.
